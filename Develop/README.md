# Horiseon-Marketing-Code-Refactor

## Description
This project was to assist Horiseon Social Solutions with creating a structured HTML codebase that provides accessibility in order for code readers to assist those who may disabilities that hinder them from reading the webpage.  In this project, a clear concise title was added and the HTML codebase was refactored in order to follow semantic HTML standards.  The CSS properties were also consolidated in order to have a cleaner, more efficient styling page.
